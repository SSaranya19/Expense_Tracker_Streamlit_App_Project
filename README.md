# Expense_Tracker_Streamlit_App_Project
This project aims to simulate an individual expense tracker using the Faker library. It involves:

1. Generating realistic monthly expense data.
2. Storing and processing data in a SQL database.
3. Running SQL queries to analyze spending behavior.
4. Developing a Streamlit app for visualizing analyses.

The tracker categorizes expenses into Food, groceries, shopping, and personal spending, offering a detailed overview of financial habits over a year.
